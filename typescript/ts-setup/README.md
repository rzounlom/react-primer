# TypeScript with Node.js Project

This project demonstrates how to set up and use TypeScript with Node.js for building a backend application. The setup includes TypeScript installation, configuration, and compiling TypeScript to JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v12.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

NOTE: Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed. You can verify this by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize a Node.js Project

- Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm:

```bash
mkdir my-typescript-project
```

- Navigate into your new directory

```bash
cd my-typescript-project
```

- Initialize a new Git repo to track changes

```bash
git init
```

- Initialize a new NPM project and accept all the defaults

```bash
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install TypeScript

- Install TypeScript locally in your project:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

- Create .gitignore file to avoid commiting node_modules and the build to Github and include the following:
  node_modules
  build

- The build folder will be generated by the typescript comiler

### 3. Create a TypeScript Configuration File

- Generate a tsconfig.json file to configure TypeScript compiler options:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

NOTE: This will create a tsconfig.json file with default settings. You can customize this file based on your project needs. A basic configuration might look like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}
```

Summary of config default config options:

- "target": "ES6": Specifies the ECMAScript version to which the TypeScript code will be compiled. In this case, it is set to ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).
- "module": "commonjs": Defines the module system to be used in the compiled JavaScript code. CommonJS is a widely used module system in Node.js.
- "strict": true: Enables strict type checking in TypeScript. It helps catch common errors and enforce stricter type rules.
- "esModuleInterop": true: Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ECMAScript modules. It allows importing CommonJS modules using the import syntax.
- "skipLibCheck": true: Skips type checking of declaration files (\*.d.ts). This can improve compilation performance, especially when working with large projects.
- "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true: Enforces consistent casing of file names. This helps prevent issues that can arise due to case-insensitive file systems.
- "include": ["src/**/*"]: Specifies the files or directories to be included in the TypeScript compilation process. In this case, it includes all files under the src directory.
- "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]: Specifies the files or directories to be excluded from the TypeScript compilation process. Here, it excludes the node_modules directory and any files ending with .spec.ts (typically used for testing).

### 4. Write TypeScript Code

- Create a new directory named src for your TypeScript files and add a file, e.g., index.ts:

```bash
mkdir src
```

```bash
touch src/index.ts
```

- Open src/index.ts and add your TypeScript code:

```ts
const greet = (name: string): string => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet("World"));
```

### 5. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript

- To compile TypeScript files to JavaScript, run the following command:

```bash
npx tsc
```

NOTE: This command compiles all .ts files specified in tsconfig.json and generates the corresponding .js files.

### 6. Run the Compiled JavaScript

- After compiling the TypeScript files, you can run the generated JavaScript files using Node.js:

```bash
node src/index.js
```

### 7. Add Build and Start Scripts

- To simplify the build and run process, add the following scripts to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc",
  "start": "node src/index.js",
  "dev": "npm run build && npm run start"
}
```

- Now, you can run:

```bash
npm run build   # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm start       # Run the compiled JavaScript with Node.js
npm run dev     # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript and Run the compiled JavaScript with Node.js using with one command
```
